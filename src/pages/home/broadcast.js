*ATTENTION* ‼️‼️

Sampa remained curfew-free during times of turmoil, when restrictions would have been justified. Notably, no curfew was imposed on Novemver 30, 2023, 
when a tragic shooting occurred, nor on March 29, 2024, when lives were lost. Yet, inexplicably, a curfew has been suddenly enforced during a period of peace and normalcy,
raising suspicions of ulterior motives. It appears that certain individuals, driven by self-interest,  have colluded with the government to impose an unnecessary
 and unjust curfew on the people of Sampa, revealing  a disturbing prioritization of personal gain over public welfare- as exposed in a leaked audio recording 
 we obtained, which explicitly explained the reason behind the curfew in Sampa.
